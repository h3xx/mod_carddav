mod_carddav:
------------
-this is an Apache module implementation of CardDAV support to WebDAV
-is dependent on mod_dav_acl <http://sourceforge.net/projects/moddavacl/>,
which implements RFC 3744 also as an Apache module
-uses vcard library of the Evolution Data Server (EDS)

Configuration:
--------------
-must be loaded (dlopened) after mod_dav. Depends on the base library of
mod_dav_acl.
-once the module installs, some directives from the mod_dav_acl are needed:

DAVETagResponse on
-enable strong ETag responses

DAVACL on
-enable ACL handling

CardDAV on
-enables carddav handling in a directory


Install:
--------
-preferably e.g. debuild or rpm-build. Otherwise ./configure && make &&
make install. You may need to run autogen.sh to generate a proper
./configure etc.

in debian:"sudo a2enmod dav_carddav" enables module loading and basic
configuration (though you must enable carddav in appropriate collections).


Tests:
------
-once the module is successfully compiled and loaded, tests can be run with
make check or by running ./carddav_tests. You need to have admin/password
(digest) account and /xxx/carddav directory must be available and accessible by
apache
